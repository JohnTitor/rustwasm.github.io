title:  "This Week in Rust and WebAssembly 14"
---

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust and WebAssembly*!

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.

[WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org) is a stack-based virtual machine and
instruction set. It is fast, safe, portable, and part of the open Web
platform. By compiling to WebAssembly, we can run Rust code on the Web!

This is a weekly summary of Rust and WebAssembly's progress and community.

  roadmap.](https://rustwasm.github.io/2019/03/12/lets-build-gloo-together.html)
  We've been having lots of good discussion about scope and API design in issue
  threads! (Not doing lots of PRs quite yet.)
* @OddCoincidence [added support for
  `setInterval`](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/pull/24) to `gloo-timers`.

### `rustwasm.github.io`

* @DebugSteven [removed some unused CSS
  rules](https://github.com/rustwasm/rustwasm.github.io/pull/43) from our
  Website's stylesheets.

### `rust-webpack-template`

* @alexcrichton [upgraded the
  template](https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template/pull/120) to the
  Rust 2018 edition.

### Twiggy

* @data-pup [upgraded Twiggy](https://github.com/rustwasm/twiggy/pull/265) to
  the Rust 2018 edition.
* @data-pup [added more tests](https://github.com/rustwasm/twiggy/pull/268) for
  the `twiggy diff` subcommand.

### `wasm-bindgen`

* [**We released `wasm-bindgen` version 0.2.39!
  ðŸŽ‰**](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0239)
* @c410-f3r made `wasm-bindgen`'s generated TypeScript interfaces' functions'
  argument names be [preserved from the Rust
  source](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1344) instead of being
  generated symbols.
* @ibaryshnikov [cleaned up](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1336)
  our Web GL example.

  whitelisting](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1333) for
  `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBufferView`, and `BufferSource`.
* @RReverser [fixed some copy-paste
  errors](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1372) in documentation
  for `Int32Array` and `Uint32Array`
* @RReverser [cleaned up and de-duplicated our binding
  definitions](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1371) to the
  different kinds of typed arrays!
* @c410-f3r [expanded the
  testing](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1356) of our emitted
  TypeScript interface definitions.

  ðŸŽ‰**](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#%EF%B8%8F-070)
* @alexcrichton [added support for the `web`
  target](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/567) to `wasm-pack`. This
  target uses browsers' native support for ES modules, and doesn't require the
  use of a JS bundler.
* @alexcrichton [started migrating `wasm-pack`'s CLI
  output](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/547) towards our 1.0 vision
  for `wasm-pack` output. Notably, `cargo build`'s colors and progress bar
