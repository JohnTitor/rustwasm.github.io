title:  "This Week in Rust and WebAssembly NNN"
---

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust and WebAssembly*!

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.

[WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org) is a stack-based virtual machine and
instruction set. It is fast, safe, portable, and part of the open Web
platform. By compiling to WebAssembly, we can run Rust code on the Web!

This is a weekly summary of Rust and WebAssembly's progress and community.
